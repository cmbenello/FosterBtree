### Open Questions

* [] How many threads are needed to get comparable performance with a single-threaded execution?

## Add Logging

* [x] Add log buffer with append and flush capabilities

## Visualize foster b-tree

```sh
wasm-pack build --target web
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
May need to comment out `criterion` in `Cargo.toml` to build for wasm.

## Multi-thread logger

See `logger.rs` and

```sh
cargo run --features "log_trace"
```

## Benchmarking notes

```sh
cargo bench
```

### Result (temp)

#### Test scenario

Measured the time taken to insert kvs.

```

## Perf

```sh
cargo build --release
perf record -e cycles -g --call-graph dwarf ./target/release/main 
hotspot perf.data
```

if sudo is needed, set `echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` and `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict`.
To install `perf`, `apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r``
To install `hotspot`, `apt-get install hotspot`

## Heaptrack

Heaptrack is a heap memory profiler. To install, `apt-get install heaptrack heaptrack-gui`.
To profile, `heaptrack <binary> <my params>`. This will open a gui to analyze the heap memory usage.
To open the gui later, `heaptrack_gui <heaptrack.log>`
